# Cypress Automation Learning Journey

Welcome to my comprehensive repository for Cypress Automation testing. This project tracks my learning progress, professional documentation, and homework assignments as a Software QA Automation Engineer Candidate.

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository is organized into modules to keep the learning path clear and accessible:

- **[Cypress Guidebook](./Cypress-Guidebook-byMugeEtik/):** My personal, in-depth documentation of Cypress fundamentals, locators, and best practices.
- **[Lesson 01 - Automation Basics](./goit_automation-lesson1/):** Initial environment setup and my first automated test scenarios.
- **Future Lessons:** More modules will be added as I progress through the curriculum.

## 🛡️ Development & Version Control Standards
Quality is not just about writing tests; it's also about how we manage our code history. This project strictly follows the version control workflows and documentation standards detailed in my:
